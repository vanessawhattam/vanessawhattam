I'm a data scientist excited about creating excellent data visualizations and supporting teams organization-wide with using data effectively. To that end, I've developed data pipelines to support teams in monitoring data flow from external sources 🧐, built dashboards to share health statistics with communities 📈, and developed a nationwide coding community of practice 👥. 

I specialize in coding in R, Python, and SQL, with the goal of communicating findings to audiences from diverse professional backgrounds. When I'm not behind my computer, I'm running 🏃‍♀️ on my local trails with my dogs 🐶🐶.
